# FluentValidation
lets Learn with eachother 

Fluent validation with example

We use Fluent validation for the validation of the models that we have In fact,
we can also use Dataanotation Depending on the application,
it is very important to choose one of these two for the statistical validity of the models This is how we evaluate the models that are filled by the user There are other ways for validation and not only these two ways


FluentValidation is a popular .NET library for building strongly-typed validation rules. When making an application that exposes an API to other systems or a front-end to users, you wanna make sure that data entered or parsed to your application is valid.

By using a .NET library like FluentValidation you can easily configure validation rules with lambda expressions. The library even allows you to enter an error message to the client with details about why the validation failed
